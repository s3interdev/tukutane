# Tukutane

Tukutane is a meetup web application that makes it possible for developers all over Africa to sign up and register for their favourite developer meetups.

A developer can sign up and create a new meetup as well as list all other available meetups. A developer should only be able to edit or remove a meetup that they have created.

Other developers who are not meetup creators, should also be able to list all upcoming meetups and have the choice to either register or unregister for the meetups.

All developers have the ability to sign up, sign in and change their passwords on record.
